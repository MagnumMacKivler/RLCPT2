Welcome to the Convenient, Classic Carspawner! This E2 is the next generation in car spawning technologies, allowing the user to 
spawn many styles of train, pre-detailed, and in an intuitive manner. It's also open-source and modification-friendly.

Type ".help" in chat for a guide on how to use the E2. It will show you through all you need to know on running this E2.

Made by Metaladon: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198077247660/

    WEIGHT_MULTIPLIER = 0.5 #Controls average car weight. 0.5 would make that 50 tons, and 2 would make it 200 tons. Default is 1 (averaging 100 tons).
    
    LOADED_CHANCE = 0.6 #Chance the car will be loaded (heavier). Default is 0.6, or 60% chance, since railroads often re-load cars on the return trip. Default is 0.6.
    
    LOAD_IMPACT = 0.5 #What quantity of total weight of the car is determined by the load. Lower values mean less overal variance between loaded and unloaded cars. Default is 0.5.
    
    PRINTING_DETAIL = 2 #If 0, the E2 will not output any messages. 1 is only high-importance messages, and 2 is all messages. Default is 2.

    DISPLAY_TAGS = 0 #If 1, the system will display tags after it finishes searching. Default is 0.
    
    SCANNER_VISIBLE = 0 #If 1, the scanner bogie is visible when scanning. Default is 0.
    
    SAFE_MODE = 0 #If 1, all processes will be limited by perf(), which is more stable on servers with a low tick quota but will also make the E2 significantly slower. Default is 0.
    
    FOLLOW_RAILS = 1 #If 0, the system will spawn cars in a straight line with no collision checks. If 1, the system will follow the rails check for valid placement. Default is 1.
    
    BLOCK_STACK_SIZE = 15 #This var controls how much cars of the same type clump together. Higher values means more, longer strings of the same car type. Default is 15.
    
    DRAWBAR_LENGTH = 0 #Extra slack let out between cars. Can lead to a bumpy ride, but increases realism. Default is 0, suggested is 10 (inches).
    
    NO_TF2_CARS = 0 #Remove TF2 cars from the pool. For those who dislike them. 1 removes the cars. Default is 0.
    
    LIMIT_CAR_LENGTH = 0 #If 1, removes the longest cars that behave poorly on maps like SSG2. Default is 0.
    
    RAILHEAD_EXTRA_HEIGHT = 3 #How much higher off the rails do you want the car to spawn to avoid banked curves? Default is 2, but I jacked it up to 3.
    
    Flipping_Direction = 0 #Which direction do you want the system to face cars? 0 for Random, 1 for one way, -1 for other way. Default is 0.

    CONTAINER_SECTION_LENGTH = 30 #How many containers to go, on average, until the types reset.

    Key:
    
    1: Model Name (the full path)
    2: Weighted chance to spawn (5 is uncommon, 100 will spawn in droves)
    3: Tags (typically having a country, type, load status, kind, manifest/unitfreight, detail level, modeler, era(s), and bogie type)
    4: Car placement data
     4a: Length from bogie mount to bogie mount (in inches)
     4b: Vertical offset (from the 0 point of the chosen bogie)
     4c: Rotation offset (for cars like Grove's that spawn 90 degrees rotated)
     4d: Extra coupler space (in inches)
    5: Submaterials (numbers are paired, the first number in the pair determines what mat to apply, and the second determines what ID to apply to)
     1st Submat number is laid out like this:
     1: Main
     2: Secondary
     3: Frame
     4: Wood (for flatcars)
     5: Black (for roofing)
     6: Shiny (for roofing)
     7: Coal (for coal cars)
     8: Reflector (for tankers)
    6: Coloration (each slot determines the # chance for that color to be used on the car)
     Colors are laid out like this:
     1: Red
     2: Orange
     3: White
     4: Yellow
     5: Green
     6: Blue
     7: Black
     8: Gray
     9: Aluminum (for unpainted aluminum hoppers)
     10: Wood (for early wooden cars)
     11: Tuscan (unique from red with less saturation)
     12: PC Green (unique to PC cars)
     13: NSW Brown (for NSW cars)
     14: Ore Pink (for pink Ore cars)
    7: Skin (2 numbers for maximum and minimum skin value)
    8: Bodygroups (array containing vectors, each vector randomises 1 bodygroup)
     8a: What bodygroup ID to change
     8b: Minimum value
     8c: Maximum value
    9: Weight (in tons)

    #Here's the standard.
    #The first string, obviously, is the model.
    #The second number represents how far away the origin of the model is from the railhead. 0 means the center of the model is on the rails.
    #The third number concerns how high overall the bolster of the car should be from the railhead. This should be pretty similar for most bogies of the same gauge.
    #The fourth number is for 90-degree offsets; it gets added to the angle to correct off-by-90 bogie models.
    #The fifth vector is the color.
    #The sixth string is extra strings that might be used to search for the bogie when someone forces a bogie type. Not super relevant.
    #The seventh array is for setting bodygroups on the bogie; pairs of "slot/option".
