If you're seeing this from the Github page, here's some instructions on how to install the E2:

1: Select the RAW option on the right. This will take you to a blank page with the script on it.

2: Right-click the screen and select "Save As". Save the file to your downloads as the default name.

3: Move that text file to steamapps/common/garrysmod/garrysmod/data/expression2.

4: Click "Refresh" on the E2 tool sidebar interface in Garry's Mod.

5: Find the file by searching "carspawner" or some other keyword in the e2 search bar.

6: Double click on the file to open it, then click the X at the top-right to close the window.

7: Left-click between the rails you want to spawn on, and the chip will align itself to the track.

8: Done! Follow the ingame tutorial after you've placed the chip for usage and how-to's.

Welcome to the Convenient, Classic Carspawner! This E2 is the next generation in car spawning technologies, allowing the user to spawn many styles of train, pre-detailed, and in an intuitive manner.

Type ".help" in chat for a guide on how to use the E2. It will show you through all you need to know on running this E2.


Not much of a description here. If you want more, bug me on Discord or Steam.

    #Here's some settings for those who are so inclined:
    
    WEIGHTMUL = 0.5 #The modifier on the weight of cars spawned by the chip. 1 is the default, spawning cars that average ~100 tons (average loaded weight IRL). 0.75 would reduce that average to 75 tons. 
    
    LOADCHANCE = 0.6 #Chance the car will be loaded (heavier). Default is 0.6, or 60% chance, since railroads often re-load cars on the return trip. Loaded cars are usually 3 or 4 times heavier than empty cars.
    
    LOADVAL = 0.5 #What quantity of total weight of the car is determined by the load. Lower values mean less overal variance between loaded and unloaded cars. Default is 1.
    
    NOPRNT = 0 #If 1, the E2 will not output any messages. 1 to disable messages, 0 to enable. Default is 0.
    
    DISPLAYTAGS = 0 #If 1, the system will display tags after it finishes searching.
    
    VISIBLESCAN = 1 #If 1, the scanner bogie is visible when scanning.
    
    SAFEMODE = 0 #If 1, all processes will be limited by perf(), which is more stable on servers with a low tick quota but will also make the E2 significantly slower. Reccomended 0.
    
    SPWNBHVIOR = 1 #If 0, the system will spawn cars in a straight line with no collision checks. If 1, the system will follow the rails check for valid placement. Reccomended 1.
    
    STACKSIZE = 15 #This var controls how much cars of the same type clump together. Higher values means more, longer strings of the same car type. Default 15.
    
    #[Here's where you add your own custom cars, if you feel like it.
    
    Key:
    
    1: Model Name (the full path)
    2: Weighted chance to spawn (5 is uncommon, 100 will spawn in droves)
    3: Tags (typically having a country, type, load status, kind, manifest/unitfreight, detail level, modeler, era(s), and bogie type)
    4: Car placement data
     4a: Length from bogie mount to bogie mount (in inches)
     4b: Vertical offset (from the 0 point of the chosen bogie)
     4c: Rotation offset (for cars like Grove's that spawn 90 degrees rotated)
     4d: Extra coupler space (in inches)
    5: Submaterials (numbers are paired, the first number in the pair determines what mat to apply, and the second determines what ID to apply to)
     1st Submat number is laid out like this:
     1: Main
     2: Secondary
     3: Frame
     4: Wood (for flatcars)
     5: Black (for roofing)
     6: Shiny (for roofing)
     7: Coal (for coal cars)
     8: Reflector (for tankers)
    6: Coloration (each slot determines the # chance for that color to be used on the car)
     Colors are laid out like this:
     1: Red
     2: Orange
     3: White
     4: Yellow
     5: Green
     6: Blue
     7: Black
     8: Gray
     9: Aluminum (for unpainted aluminum hoppers)
     10: Wood (for early wooden cars)
     11: Tuscan (unique from red with less saturation)
     12: PC Green (unique to PC cars)
     13: NSW Brown (for NSW cars)
    7: Skin (2 numbers for maximum and minimum skin value)
    8: Bodygroups (array containing vectors, each vector randomises 1 bodygroup)
     8a: What bodygroup ID to change
     8b: Minimum value
     8c: Maximum value
    9: Weight (in tons)
